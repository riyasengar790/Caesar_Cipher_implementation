#Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder project! This Python program empowers users to encode and decode messages using the classical Caesar cipher technique.

##Overview
The Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program offers a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages with customizable shift values.

##Features
Encode Messages: Users can encode their messages by specifying the desired shift value.
Decode Messages: Encoded messages can be decoded by entering the original shift value.
Shift Wrapping: The program gracefully handles shifts greater than 26, ensuring that the shift wraps around the alphabet.

#Getting Started
